Individual course booking system for recurring events and specific needs.

== Description ==
There are many booking systems on the market. The booking systems often have many advantages. However, one disadvantage that should not be underestimated is that many booking systems are so general that they do not address special features and individual needs of you. At ComMotion we have developed an individual course and online booking system that takes into account the special features of your company.

Our individual course and online booking system already comes with a lot of things, such as the online purchase of single tickets or 10-tickets with different payment methods, the display of a timetable and the offer of a video library. We will be happy to implement any further requests together with you, so that in the end you will receive exactly THE booking system that you need. The following features are included in our course and online booking system:

= Integration =
The system fully supports WooCommerce. Part of the booking system is a powerful online shop that leaves nothing to be desired. You can sell everything from single cards to mixed cards of 10 to subscriptions.

= Attendance indicator =
Every course or appointment has a current utilization indicator. This gives you full control over all appointments.

= Customer account =
Each customer receives individual access. This means that he has an overview of all appointments and bookings and can make purchases in the online shop.

= Permanent appointments and subscriptions =
You can enter permanent appointments (subscription or permanent place) for certain customers and thus reward your regular customers.

= Opening times and timetable =
The system fully supports WooCommerce. Part of the booking system is a powerful online shop that leaves nothing to be desired. You can sell everything from single cards to mixed cards of 10 to subscriptions.

= Advantages of the individual course and online booking system from ComMotion =
The advantages are apparent. With a booking system that is perfectly tailored to you, you and your entire team not only save more time because the administrative effort is lower, but you also give your customers an extremely professional impression.

Through the online shop, which we can integrate into your website in addition to the booking system, you will sell your products, cards and offers online in the future - 24 hours a day.

A nice side effect: thanks to the optional status display, customers can see whether places are still available and can register for appointments at short notice. This ensures that your courses and appointments are fully utilized.

= Recommended Requirements =
* PHP 8.2 or greater is recommended
* MySQL 5.7 or greater is recommended

= Automatic installation =
Automatic installation is the easiest option -- WordPress will handles the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”
 
In the search field type ”Course Booking System” then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found us, you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by! Click “Install” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =
Manual installation method requires downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

= Updating =
Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

If you encounter issues with the course pages after an update, flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting “Save”. That should return things to normal.
